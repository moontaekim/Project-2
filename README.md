# Project 2: Pedal Doctor

Have you ever listented a song and wondered "how in the world is this guitarist getting that sound?". Well now you have a guide. Pedal Doctor is a full stack application/forum that allows users to share their findings. You can create a guitarist, add songs, and even add what pedals you think they used for that song.

Every user has the ability to add and delete whatever they want on this application. Please be **careful**  and **thoughtful** before deleting other users findings.
